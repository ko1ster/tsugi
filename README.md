# evrythng-webapp

Sample mobile web app that interacts with EVRYTHNG. Built with Web Components + Polymer + Material Design.

All requests are done locally if there is an EVRYTHNG Hub in the network and its address is configured correctly in the application.

Change Hub Address

Open up the application, logging in with any existing Facebook user.

Go to Settings and change the 'Local Hub Address' setting. This will be persisted locally, so the next time you open the application it will use that address by default.

#### Supported browsers

Browser support is basically the same as stated for Polymer ~1.*. All major evergreen browsers.

#### Deploy your application to github pages
